In this work, I explore the dialectical relationship between opposites and the interplay between their exterior forms and intrinsic contradictions. It reflects on the harmonious balance between contradiction and unity.

The transformation of multi-colored particles symbolizes the impermanence of the external world, while the enduring opposition of black and white represents the fundamental duality of existence. Viewers are invited to interact with these opposites, moving them to create their desired visual effectsâ€”whether neat and harmonious, chaotic and messy, or entirely devoid of opposites.

Each interaction with these opposing forces becomes a journey of self-exploration and profound communication, encouraging viewers to reflect on their personal perceptions of balance, conflict, and resolution.
